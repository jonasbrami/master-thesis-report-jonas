\section{Project Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement the planning and spherical velocity field in a simple simulation with the quadcopter dynamics
    \item Implement it on ROS to make it run on gazebo
    \item Use the depth sensor camera to generate the field with the live sensor data using the PCL library
    \item Make a ML model to compute the optimal pitch vector taking as input the profile of the quadcopter, surface normal and desired applied force

A measure of success would be to succesfully implement the whole pipepile from perception to velocity fields together with PVFC and making it work with a real quadcopter in the lab. A first success would be to have it working without obtacles and with a simple vertical target surface. 
When we have this working, a full success would be to have it working for diverse kind of obstacles and non trivial target surfaces.
A total success would be to be able to maintain contact with the target when applying external forces/torques on the UAV.
