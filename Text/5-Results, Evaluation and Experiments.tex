\section{Results, Evaluation and Experiments}
In this section, we will discuss the results obtained in multiple conditions. Those data were recorded using ROSBag and were parsed using the ROSBag python module.
We provide a jupyter notebook in the repository that facilitates drawing all the relevant graphs with a convenient way of storing all the parsed bags inside a pickle file.

\subsection{Compensation for drag}

\subsection{Gusty world}

\subsection{Windy world}

\subsection{gamma analysis}

\subsection{Ebar analysis}



 \begin{itemize}
    \item Calibrate thrust
    \item  introduction of compensation terms for friction
    \item finetuning (Ax Ay Az). too high cause speed to diverge, too low the quad lose all its energy and stop. 
    \item beta error
    \item presents experiences in different worlds
    \item using wind world helped lead the way to understand the need for compensation
    \item Analyze Ebar, Gamma
 \end{itemize}
