\section{Results, Evaluation and Experiments}
\subsection{ Compensation for drag }

\subsection{ Gusty world }

\subsection{ Windy world }


 \begin{itemize}
    \item Calibrate thrust
    \item  introduction of compensation terms for friction
    \item finetuning (Ax Ay Az). too high cause speed to diverge, too low the quad lose all its energy and stop. 
    \item beta error
    \item presents experiences in different worlds
    \item using wind world helped lead the way to understand the need for compensation
    \item Analyze Ebar, Gamma
 \end{itemize}
