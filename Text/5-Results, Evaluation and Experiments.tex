\subsection{Introduction}
 \begin{itemize}
    \item general motivation/background of this study: 
    \item PVFC controller (l)
    \item Implementing this controller requires velocity field , that is updated based on current position.
          someone studied velocity field using potential, briefly describes the main principle. 
           Explain why this technique is suitable/beneficial to your project (compared to other methods for velocity field).
    \item Calibrate thrust
    \item  error within the framework of this controller due to the neglecting gravity and friction
          someone did a study on compensating for these errors, briefly introduce the principle. The right amout of (Ax Ay Az) 
          can improve ... performance. However, ... diverge ... also talk about  beta 
    \item PCL: 
    \item Gazebo modified : arm, pcl modified
 \end{itemize}

%  \subsection*{future work}
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item estimate optimal parameters of E_bar, Gamma gains, a's to reduce input-output difference
